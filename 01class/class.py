# Class is a Blueprint.
# Every Object which is present belongs to a class.
a=2
print(type(a)) # You will see the class int
# It means that every variable is an object in the Python.

# List is a class which has functions in it.
l=[1,2,3,4]
l.append(5)
print(l)
# A data-type is a class and variable that we make of that class 
# is an Object of that class.
# EX: List is a class and l=[1,2] , here, l is an object of class List.


# Class has two things : Data(Property) and Functions(Behavior)
# Example of Structure of Class
# class Car:
#   color="black" #data
#   model="2022" #data

#   def calc_avg_speed(dist,time):
#     some code
